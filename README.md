# Time-Series-Analysis-Using-Particle-Swarm-Optimization-and-Sea-temperature-forecasting

Forecasted sea surface temperatures for the next 1200 months using cutting-edge ARIMA, SARIMA, and SARIMAX models, 
skillfully leveraging Stationarity, auto-correlation , and Partial auto-correlation concepts to optimize model parameters.
Enhanced prediction accuracy through the implementation of Particle Swarm Optimization.

# PSO_project_code

This file mainly deals with the Airline Passengers dataset, predict the number of passegers traveeling through air based on the previous 50 years of the data. Used models like 
ARIMA, SARIMA and SARIMAX to do the preediction and then ompared the results of all the three.

# Project_2

This code file mainly deals with the prediction of Sea surface tempurature collected from the 
Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Systems which consisted the temperatures of the prvious 100 years. Used the same models and ideas to do the predictions.
